# Unit-of-work

The unit of work pattern is a design pattern that is used to group a set of operations that are performed on a database into a single transaction or “unit of work”. The unit of work pattern is used to ensure that all operations are performed on the database in a single transaction. This ensures that all operations are performed in a consistent manner and that the database is in a consistent state after the transaction is completed.
